In this guide, you will learn how to configure an application to use the
{+provider-long+}. To learn how to set up a new project and install the
{+provider-short+}, see the :ref:`entity-framework-quickstart`.

Create a POCO
-------------

Create a `Plain old CLR/Class object
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object>`__, or **POCO**, to use as
a model for your entity. A POCO is a simple class object that doesn't inherit
features from any framework-specific base classes or interfaces.

To learn more about POCOs, see the :driver:`POCO guide
</csharp/current/fundamentals/serialization/poco/>` in the
{+csharp-driver-short+} documentation.

The following code example shows how to create a Customer POCO:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/configure/ConfigureEFProvider.cs
   :start-after: start-customer
   :end-before: end-customer
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:

Create a DB Context Class
-------------------------

To begin using Entity Framework, create a class that derives from 
`DBContext <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.dbcontext>`__.
The ``DBContext`` class represents a session with the database and is used to
query and save instances of your entities.

The ``DBContext`` class exposes ``DBSet`` properties that specify the entities you
can interact with while using that context.

The following example creates a ``DBContext`` class and specifies the
``Customer`` object as the ``DBSet`` property:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/configure/ConfigureEFProvider.cs
   :start-after: start-db-context
   :end-before: end-db-context
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:

This code example overrides the ``OnModelCreating()`` method. Overriding
the ``OnModelCreating`` method allows you to specify configuration details for your
model and its properties. This example uses the ``ToCollection()`` method to
specify that the ``Customer`` entity should map to the ``customers`` collection.

.. TODO: Link to a page that goes over methods available to use in OnModelCreating

Use MongoDB
-----------

Once you have created a ``DBContext`` class, pass the ``UseMongoDB()`` method to
the ``DbContext`` class to begin using the {+provider-long+}. The
``UseMongoDB()`` method takes two parameters: a ``MongoClient`` instance, and
the name of the database that stores the collections you are working with.

Pass the ``UseMongoDB()`` method as show in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/configure/ConfigureEFProvider.cs
   :start-after: start-use-mongodb
   :end-before: end-use-mongodb
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:

.. tip:: Connection URI

   The {+provider-short+} allows you to access methods from
   the {+csharp-driver-long+} in your application. The previous example uses the
   ``MongoClient()`` method from the {+csharp-driver-short+} to create a MongoDB
   client that connects to a MongoDB instance. To learn more about connecting to
   MongoDB with the {+csharp-driver-long+} see the 
   :driver:`Connection guide </csharp/current/fundamentals/connection/connect/>`
   in the {+csharp-driver-short+} documentation.
